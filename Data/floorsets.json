More cannot be found here, unfortunately.\nThis is the scariest set in terms of the regular floors. 87-89 have absolutely terrible mobs that you mostly won't want to fight solo. 86 can be bad too, but is a bit more random in the enemies you'll see. The usual plan is to get as far as you can with minimal pomander usage, and then use what you need to get through the last few floors.\n* Alterations are great here - if you get mandragoras, great! If you get mimics, they're still much better than most of the other enemies. * Rage is great, and there are a couple optimal ways to use it   * Use fortune and clear the entire floor (or as much as possible), then go     back to collect your loot. Even better if you planned ahead and used     affluence as well.   * Double-rage - collect as many chests as you can and locate the exit     before-hand, then use rage, clear enemies close to the exit as quickly as     possible and go into the portal with rage still active. You can then     continue killing a few enemies on the next floor before it wears off. * Flights are not great here as they don't combine well with alteration, and   don't save you much time with rage either since the enemies are more   spread out. Flight will save more time on the earlier floors that you're   going to fight through if you need it.\nBe aware of the wall traps on these floors.
